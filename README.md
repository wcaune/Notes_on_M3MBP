# Notes_on_M3MBP
Notes after I got my M3Max Macbook Pro
###  Install ROOT 6.32
First step is to install CMake 3.29 from the command line terminal. See 
Frederico Martins's guide.

### XQuartz
After installed XQuartz, run the following command in terminal.
```bash
defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 enable_iglx -bool true
```
Then type 
```bash
xclock
```
to see if it is enabled.

### Fetch
I used my ‘.edu’ email account to apply for a free version of Fetch. Now I’m using SFTP to connect.

### BBEdit or Sublime
I finally purchased a BBEdit 15.

### Eduroam Network at Fermilab
The account is username@WIN.FERMI.GOV and the password is the same as your Fermilab service password.

### Github and NOvA software
I follow the wiki page to link Github, my M3Max Macbook Pro and the novagpvm nodes together.
